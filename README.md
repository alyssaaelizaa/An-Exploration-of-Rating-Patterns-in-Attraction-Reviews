# An-Exploration-of-Rating-Patterns

# I conducted an in-depth analysis of individual rating patterns for various attractions using K-means clustering and K-nearest neighbor algorithms, laying the groundwork for enhancing travel recommendation systems. Through this analysis, I identified six distinct clusters of travelers with similar preferences, providing valuable insights to improve travel experiences and generate business for smaller companies. Additionally, our model achieved an impressive 95% accuracy in classifying travelers into their respective clusters using the KNN algorithm, showcasing the proficiency of the model in categorizing travelers based on their interests. This research not only advances our understanding of traveler behavior but also offers a promising avenue for more personalized and effective travel recommendations in the future.
